Workflow:

1. The user has to first register a new account or login using one of the predefined users from the tablein the Assignment 1 instructions.

    Role                Username                    Password
    Admin               a@a.a                       P@$$w0rd
    Board member 1      1@1.1                       P@$$w0rd
    Board member 2      2@2.2                       P@$$w0rd
    Board member 3      3@3.3                       P@$$w0rd
    Board member 4      4@4.4                       P@$$w0rd
    Board member 5      comp4976@outlook.com        P@$$w0rd

    We replaced the Username and Email for Board member 5 to 'comp4976@outlook.com'. This account has been registered, but the email
    has not been confirmed specifically for testing purposes. To use this account, the user should visit the Login page, then click
    the 'Resend email confirmation' button. 

2. Once the user is logged in, they can visit the Resolutions page, where they can draft a new resolution by clicking 'Create New'.
    Note that the Abstract section for the resolution is a rich text editor (QuillJS).

3. The table headers on the Resolutions page have clickable buttons for the Status and Board Member columns, which allow the user
    to filter the table results by status or by name.

4. When a new Resolution has been created, an email will be sent to all Board Member users. For testing purposes, we hardcoded the
    MailService so that it sends only 1 email to 'comp4976@outlook.com'. 

5. The email should contain a link that redirects the user to the Details page of the newly drafted resolution, where the user can
    create their Feedback and choose either 'Reject' or 'Accept'.

6. When the feedback is created, note that the resolution Status changes from 'Draft' to 'Accept' or 'Rejected'. If there are an even
    number of Accepted and Rejected feedbacks, the status will be 'Incomplete'.

7. If a user logs in as an admin, there will be a 'Roles' tab in the navigation bar. This page allows the admin to create new roles,
    and set users to multiple or single roles. Note that the 'Admin' role cannot be deleted, and if a role is deleted while there are
    users registered to that role, they will all be removed from that role.
